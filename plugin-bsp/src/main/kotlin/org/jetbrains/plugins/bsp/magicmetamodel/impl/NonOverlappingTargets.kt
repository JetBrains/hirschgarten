/**
 * ## Conflicting Targets Problem
 *
 * The main purpose of the NonOverlappingTargets class is to resolve a mismatch between BSP model and IntelliJ model
 *
 * Roughly speaking, BSP allows targets to share source files. For example, let's assume a project contains
 * two libraries named libfoo and libbar, and three files named a.java, b.java and c.java.
 *
 * In BSP, it is perfectly valid for libfoo to contain a.java and b.java, while libbar contains b.java and c.java.
 * In this case we say that libfoo and libbar are *conflicting* targets.
 *
 * Unfortunately, in IntelliJ model, the relationship between file and module is one-to-one, so if we want to import
 * each BSP target as a separate module, we need to ignore some targets, to make sure there are no conflicting ones.
 *
 *
 * ## NonOverlappingTargets resolver
 * The `NonOverlappingTargets` class tries to run a heuristic that will drop some targets and return a result that is
 * a subset of all targets in which any element is not conflicting with any other.
 *
 * It takes two parameters,
 * - `allTargets` - a set of targets we are trying to import
 * - `conflictGraph` - a graph defining which target conflicts with each other. It is just a map, where the value is
 * a set of targets that conflict with the key.
 *
 * ## The algorithm
 * The algorithm works in that way, it iterates as long as the conflict graph is not empty. During each iteration, it
 * takes all the targets that has no conflicts, and adds them to the result list. We name them the *accepted* ones.
 * The targets (if there are any) are therefore removed from the conflict graph.
 * After that, it chooses a `worst` target (described below) and deletes it from the conflict graph, too.
 *
 * ## The worst target
 * When conflicting targets exist, there is no objective way to find out which one should be removed. That's why we need
 * to apply arbitrary heuristic. The heurisic we currently use is defined in `chooseWorstConflict` method and is defined
 * as follows
 * 1. Out of all targets that still has not been *accepted*, we find ones that are dependent on the *accepted* ones.
 * We call them *dependers*. We just find a target conflicting with any of the *dependers*.
 * 2. If step one did not provide any result, we just take a target that has the biggest number of conflicts
 *
