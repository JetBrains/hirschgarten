The testData folder contains .textproto files which are the result of running our aspect over a project.

They should be updated in case a new mandatory field is added to the proto etc.

samplerepo folder has proto files generated from `server/e2e/test-projects/bzlmod/sample-repo`.
go folder has proto files generated from `server/e2e/test-projects/bzlmod/go-project`.
python folder has proto files generated from `https://github.com/JetBrainsBazelBot/simpleBazelProjectsForTesting/commit/1fe1e07dcf5d50868e10f3e6e87f2c4e95b4c290`.

You can use `bazel run //tools/aspect_output_extractor -- <path to a project>` to get the list of proto files generated by the aspect.
