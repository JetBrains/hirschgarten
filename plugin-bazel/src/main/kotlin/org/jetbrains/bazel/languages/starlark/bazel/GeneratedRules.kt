    <p>
      Building the <code>&lt;<var>name</var>&gt;_deploy.jar</code> target for your rule
      creates a self-contained jar file with a manifest that allows it to be run with the
      <code>java -jar</code> command or with the wrapper script's <code>--singlejar</code>
      option. Using the wrapper script is preferred to <code>java -jar</code> because it
      also passes the JVM flags and the options
      to load native libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deploy jar contains all the classes that would be found by a classloader that
      searched the classpath from the binary's wrapper script from beginning to end. It also
      contains the native libraries needed for dependencies. These are automatically loaded
      into the JVM at runtime.
    </p>
    <p>If your target specifies a launcher
      attribute, then instead of being a normal JAR file, the _deploy.jar will be a
      native binary. This will contain the launcher plus any native (C++) dependencies of
      your rule, all linked into a static binary. The actual jar file's bytes will be
      appended to that native binary, creating a single binary blob containing both the
      executable and the Java code. You can execute the resulting jar file directly
      like you would execute any native binary.</p>

    collected from the transitive closure of the target. These will match the classes in the

It is good practice to use the name of the source file that is the main entry point of the

  Summary: a rule <i>X</i> can access the code in <i>Y</i> if there exists a dependency
  path between them that begins with a <code>deps</code> edge followed by zero or more
  <code>exports</code> edges. Let's see some examples to illustrate this.
</p>
<p>
  Assume <i>A</i> depends on <i>B</i> and <i>B</i> depends on <i>C</i>. In this case
  C is a <em>transitive</em> dependency of A, so changing C's sources and rebuilding A will
  correctly rebuild everything. However A will not be able to use classes in C. To allow
  that, either A has to declare C in its <code>deps</code>, or B can make it easier for A
  (and anything that may depend on A) by declaring C in its (B's) <code>exports</code>
  attribute.
</p>
<p>
  The closure of exported libraries is available to all direct parent rules. Take a slightly
  different example: A depends on B, B depends on C and D, and also exports C but not D.
  Now A has access to C but not to D. Now, if C and D exported some libraries, C' and D'
  respectively, A could only access C' but not D'.
</p>
<p>
  Important: an exported rule is not a regular dependency. Sticking to the previous example,
  if B exports C and wants to also use C, it has to also list it in its own
  <code>deps</code>.
