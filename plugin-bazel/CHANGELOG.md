It will automatically infer and load only targets in this folder and its subfolders.</p> <p>Please consider switching to Nightly channel in <code>Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Bazel -> Advanced Settings</code><br> Switching to nightly you'll get newest features and fixes faster!</p> <p>Please file any issue on our <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/BAZEL">YouTrack</a> or reach to us directly on slack <a href="https://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/C025SBYFC4E">#intellij @ slack.bazel.build</a></p> <h2>Features</h2> <ul> <li>[feature] Added ability to automatically infer and create project targets when opening a BUILD file or its directory, simplifying project setup for large Bazel repositories. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1388">BAZEL-1388</a></li> <li>[feature] Added ability to automatically open Bazel projects when selecting WORKSPACE or MODULE.bazel files | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1421">BAZEL-1421</a></li> <li>[feature] Added option to perform standard APK installation as an alternative to mobile-install for Android applications | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1425">BAZEL-1425</a></li> <li>[feature] Enhanced .bazelrc file syntax highlighting to better support tristate flags and additional Bazel command options. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1426">BAZEL-1426</a></li> </ul> <h2>Bug Fixes</h2> <ul> <li>[fix] Added automatic injection of workspace enablement flag to ensure compatibility when workspace support is explicitly disabled in Bazel configuration | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1445">BAZEL-1445</a></li> <li>[fix] Aligned server project root with Bazel workspace root to resolve template resource loading issues | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1422">BAZEL-1422</a></li> <li>[fix] Don&#x27;t reconnect on every sync if project.bazelProjectSettings.projectViewPath == null</li> <li>[fix] Fixed incorrect grouping of run configurations by creating separate configuration types for different build tools instead of using dynamic icons. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1354">BAZEL-1354</a></li> <li>[fix] Updated mobile-install to use the ADB path from system PATH instead of hardcoded location for better compatibility across different environments. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1362">BAZEL-1362</a></li> <li>[fix] fix log4j2 config for bspcli.</li> </ul> </body> </html>
