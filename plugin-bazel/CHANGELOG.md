<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <title>Bazel Plugin 2025.1.12</title> </head> <body> <h1>2025.1.12</h1> We are finally ready to announce the general availability (GA) of the new Bazel plugin by JetBrains for IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and GoLand! As of the 2025.1.12 version, this plugin is no longer considered EAP. While we've been shipping updates regularly, the leap to our 2025.2 GA release marks a major milestone. Even though our primary focus for this release was on creating the best experience we can for Java, Kotlin, and Scala developers, we also brought support for the Python and Go ecosystems, and we will continue to maintain and improve it in the coming releases. <h2>Key features in 2025.2</h2> <ul> <strong>Go is a <em>go</em></strong>. We're officially rolling out support for Go. You can now import your Go targets in Bazel projects into both IntelliJ IDEA (with the Go plugin) and GoLand. This brings the full IDE experience you rely on: code highlighting, completion, navigation, and the ability to run, debug, and get coverage for your tests. </ul> <ul> <strong>Built-in Bazel Query tool window:</strong> Go beyond sync and build with Bazel queries integrated directly into your IDE via their own dedicated tool window. Craft your queries with syntax completion and a helpful UI for flags to explore your project's dependency graph without ever leaving the editor. </ul> <ul> <strong>Dramatically faster indexing:</strong> We've optimized indexing to get you to your code faster. You can now use the import_depth and import_ijars settings in your .bazelproject file to prevent the indexing of deep transitive dependencies. Furthermore, only the files directly referenced in your .bazelproject view are fully indexed for code intelligence, which can slash indexing times and memory usage in large projects with many auxiliary files. </ul> Read the full update on the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2025/07/bazel-ga-release/">IntelliJ IDEA Blog</a> <p>RELEASE NOTES</p> <p>Please consider switching to Nightly channel in <code>Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Bazel -> Advanced Settings</code><br> Switching to nightly you'll get newest features and fixes faster!</p> <p>Please file any issue on our <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/BAZEL">YouTrack</a> or reach us directly on slack <a href="https://bazelbuild.slack.com/archives/C025SBYFC4E">#intellij @ slack.bazel.build</a></p> <h2>Current Changelog:</h2> <h3>Features since 2025.2.2</h3> <ul> <li>[feature] Added Bazel Query tool | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2138">BAZEL-2138</a></li> <li>[feature] Added a new optional 'import_ijars' section to project view configuration to help control dependency importing behavior and improve indexing performance. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2088">BAZEL-2088</a></li> <li>[feature] Added ability to add directories to project view file directly from context menus in project tree and file tabs | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1711">BAZEL-1711</a></li> <li>[feature] Added assistance features for MODULE.bazel dependency overrides, including validation checks and navigation improvements | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2165">BAZEL-2165</a></li> <li>[feature] Added autocomplete functionality for section names in .bazelproject files to improve user experience | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2169">BAZEL-2169</a></li> <li>[feature] Added autocomplete support for static values in BazelProjectView sections like workspace type, build flags, and additional languages. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2180">BAZEL-2180</a></li> <li>[feature] Added autocompletion support for Bazel Query operators to improve developer productivity when writing query commands. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2225">BAZEL-2225</a></li> <li>[feature] Added experimental support for Kotlin coroutine debugging in Bazel builds | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1900">BAZEL-1900</a></li> <li>[feature] Added extension point to allow custom Python library path resolution, enabling projects to define their own source root lookup logic. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2114">BAZEL-2114</a></li> <li>[feature] Added functionality to detect and assist with upgrading outdated Bazel versions specified in .bazelversion files. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2102">BAZEL-2102</a></li> <li>[feature] Added path completion support for remote repository files in Bazel load statements. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-1924">BAZEL-1924</a></li> <li>[feature] Added support for additional debug flags in Bazel build configuration to improve Python test debugging capabilities. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2006">BAZEL-2006</a></li> <li>[feature] Added support for specifying custom test runner arguments when executing tests through the Bazel plugin. | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2081">BAZEL-2081</a></li> <li>[feature] Added warning annotations for unsupported sections in ProjectView instead of showing parsing errors | #<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/BAZEL-2174">BAZEL-2174</a></li> <li>[feature] FastBuild hotswap logic will use toolchain resolution per target if it&#x27;s applicable.
