java_binary◊<p>
  Builds a Java archive ("jar file"), plus a wrapper shell script with the same name as the rule.
  The wrapper shell script uses a classpath that includes, among other things, a jar file for each
  library on which the binary depends. When running the wrapper shell script, any nonempty
  <code>JAVABIN</code> environment variable will take precedence over the version specified via
  Bazel's <code>--java_runtime_version</code> flag.
</p>
<p>
  The wrapper script accepts several unique flags. Refer to
  <code>java_stub_template.txt</code>
  for a list of configurable flags and environment variables accepted by the wrapper.
</p>

<h4 id="java_binary_implicit_outputs">Implicit output targets</h4>
<ul>
  <li><code><var>name</var>.jar</code>: A Java archive, containing the class files and other
    resources corresponding to the binary's direct dependencies.</li>
  <li><code><var>name</var>-src.jar</code>: An archive containing the sources ("source
    jar").</li>
  <li><code><var>name</var>_deploy.jar</code>: A Java archive suitable for deployment (only
    built if explicitly requested).
    <p>
      Building the <code>&lt;<var>name</var>&gt;_deploy.jar</code> target for your rule
      creates a self-contained jar file with a manifest that allows it to be run with the
      <code>java -jar</code> command or with the wrapper script's <code>--singlejar</code>
      option. Using the wrapper script is preferred to <code>java -jar</code> because it
      also passes the <a href="#java_binary-jvm_flags">JVM flags</a> and the options
      to load native libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deploy jar contains all the classes that would be found by a classloader that
      searched the classpath from the binary's wrapper script from beginning to end. It also
      contains the native libraries needed for dependencies. These are automatically loaded
      into the JVM at runtime.
    </p>
    <p>If your target specifies a <a href="#java_binary.launcher">launcher</a>
      attribute, then instead of being a normal JAR file, the _deploy.jar will be a
      native binary. This will contain the launcher plus any native (C++) dependencies of
      your rule, all linked into a static binary. The actual jar file's bytes will be
      appended to that native binary, creating a single binary blob containing both the
      executable and the Java code. You can execute the resulting jar file directly
      like you would execute any native binary.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code><var>name</var>_deploy-src.jar</code>: An archive containing the sources
    collected from the transitive closure of the target. These will match the classes in the
    <code>deploy.jar</code> except where jars have no matching source jar.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is good practice to use the name of the source file that is the main entry point of the
application (minus the extension). For example, if your entry point is called
<code>Main.java</code>, then your name could be <code>Main</code>.
</p>

<p>
  A <code>deps</code> attribute is not allowed in a <code>java_binary</code> rule without
  <a href="#java_binary-srcs"><code>srcs</code></a>; such a rule requires a
  <a href="#java_binary-main_class"><code>main_class</code></a> provided by
  <a href="#java_binary-runtime_deps"><code>runtime_deps</code></a>.
</p>

<p>The following code snippet illustrates a common mistake:</p>

<pre class="code">
<code class="lang-starlark">
java_binary(
    name = "DontDoThis",
    srcs = [
        <var>...</var>,
        <code class="deprecated">"GeneratedJavaFile.java"</code>,  # a generated .java file
    ],
    deps = [<code class="deprecated">":generating_rule",</code>],  # rule that generates that file
)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Do this instead:</p>

<pre class="code">
<code class="lang-starlark">
java_binary(
    name = "DoThisInstead",
    srcs = [
        <var>...</var>,
        ":generating_rule",
    ],
)
</code>

nameA unique name for this target. 	
srcs·	The list of source files that are processed to create the target.
This attribute is almost always required; see exceptions below.
<p>
Source files of type <code>.java</code> are compiled. In case of generated
<code>.java</code> files it is generally advisable to put the generating rule's name
here instead of the name of the file itself. This not only improves readability but
makes the rule more resilient to future changes: if the generating rule generates
different files in the future, you only need to fix one place: the <code>outs</code> of
the generating rule. You should not list the generating rule in <code>deps</code>
because it is a no-op.
</p>
<p>
Source files of type <code>.srcjar</code> are unpacked and compiled. (This is useful if
you need to generate a set of <code>.java</code> files with a genrule.)
</p>
<p>
Rules: if the rule (typically <code>genrule</code> or <code>filegroup</code>) generates
any of the files listed above, they will be used the same way as described for source
files.

<p>
This argument is almost always required, except if a

	resources÷A list of data files to include in a Java jar.

<p>
Resources may be source files or generated files.
</p>

<p>
If resources are specified, they will be bundled in the jar along with the usual
<code>.class</code> files produced by compilation. The location of the resources inside
of the jar file is determined by the project structure. Bazel first looks for Maven's
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html">standard directory layout</a>,
(a "src" directory followed by a "resources" directory grandchild). If that is not
found, Bazel then looks for the topmost directory named "java" or "javatests" (so, for
example, if a resource is at <code>&lt;workspace root&gt;/x/java/y/java/z</code>, the
path of the resource will be <code>y/java/z</code>. This heuristic cannot be overridden,
however, the <code>resource_strip_prefix</code> attribute can be used to specify a
specific alternative directory for resource files.2[]Ô

launcherÈSpecify a binary that will be used to run your Java program instead of the
normal <code>bin/java</code> program included with the JDK.
The target must be a <code>cc_binary</code>. Any <code>cc_binary</code> that
implements the
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/invocation.html">
Java Invocation API</a> can be specified as a value for this attribute.

<p>By default, Bazel will use the normal JDK launcher (bin/java or java.exe).</p>

<p>The related <a href="${link user-manual#flag--java_launcher}"><code>
--java_launcher</code></a> Bazel flag affects only those
<code>java_binary</code> and <code>java_test</code> targets that have
<i>not</i> specified a <code>launcher</code> attribute.</p>

<p>Note that your native (C++, SWIG, JNI) dependencies will be built differently
depending on whether you are using the JDK launcher or another launcher:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using the normal JDK launcher (the default), native dependencies are
built as a shared library named <code>{name}_nativedeps.so</code>, where
<code>{name}</code> is the <code>name</code> attribute of this java_binary rule.
Unused code is <em>not</em> removed by the linker in this configuration.</li>

<li>If you are using any other launcher, native (C++) dependencies are statically
linked into a binary named <code>{name}_nativedeps</code>, where <code>{name}</code>
is the <code>name</code> attribute of this java_binary rule. In this case,
the linker will remove any code it thinks is unused from the resulting binary,
which means any C++ code accessed only via JNI may not be linked in unless
that <code>cc_library</code> target specifies <code>alwayslink = True</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When using any launcher other than the default JDK launcher, the format
of the <code>*_deploy.jar</code> output changes. See the main

main_classäName of class with <code>main()</code> method to use as entry point.
If a rule uses this option, it does not need a <code>srcs=[...]</code> list.
Thus, with this attribute one can make an executable from a Java library that already
contains one or more <code>main()</code> methods.
<p>
The value of this attribute is a class name, not a source file. The class must be
available at runtime: it may be compiled by this rule (from <code>srcs</code>) or
provided by direct or transitive dependencies (through <code>runtime_deps</code> or
<code>deps</code>). If the class is unavailable, the binary will fail at runtime; there
is no build-time check.

<a href="common-definitions.html#sh-tokenization">Bourne shell tokenization</a>.

<p>The wrapper script for a Java binary includes a CLASSPATH definition
(to find all the dependent jars) and invokes the right Java interpreter.
The command line generated by the wrapper script includes the name of
the main class followed by a <code>"$@"</code> so you can pass along other
arguments after the classname.  However, arguments intended for parsing
by the JVM must be specified <i>before</i> the classname on the command
line.  The contents of <code>jvm_flags</code> are added to the wrapper
script before the classname is listed.</p>

<p>Note that this attribute has <em>no effect</em> on <code>*_deploy.jar</code>
outputs.</p>2[]ì
deploy_manifest_linesÛA list of lines to add to the <code>META-INF/manifest.mf</code> file generated for the

stampêWhether to encode build information into the binary. Possible values:
<ul>
<li>
  <code>stamp = 1</code>: Always stamp the build information into the binary, even in
  <a href="${link user-manual#flag--stamp}"><code>--nostamp</code></a> builds. <b>This
  setting should be avoided</b>, since it potentially kills remote caching for the
  binary and any downstream actions that depend on it.
</li>
<li>
  <code>stamp = 0</code>: Always replace build information by constant values. This
  gives good build result caching.
</li>
<li>
  <code>stamp = -1</code>: Embedding of build information is controlled by the
  <a href="${link user-manual#flag--stamp}"><code>--[no]stamp</code></a> flag.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stamped binaries are <em>not</em> rebuilt unless their dependencies change.</p>2-1›
use_testrunner¡Use the test runner (by default
<code>com.google.testing.junit.runner.BazelTestRunner</code>) class as the
main entry point for a Java program, and provide the test class
to the test runner as a value of <code>bazel.test_suite</code>
system property.

<br/>
You can use this to override the default
behavior, which is to use test runner for
<code>java_test</code> rules,
and not use it for <code>java_binary</code> rules.  It is unlikely
you will want to do this.  One use is for <code>AllTest</code>
rules that are invoked by another rule (to set up a database
before running the tests, for example).  The <code>AllTest</code>
rule must be declared as a <code>java_binary</code>, but should
still use the test runner as its main entry point.

The name of a test runner class can be overridden with <code>main_class</code> attribute.2Falseº

exports∑Exported libraries.
<p>
  Listing rules here will make them available to parent rules, as if the parents explicitly
  depended on these rules. This is not true for regular (non-exported) <code>deps</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Summary: a rule <i>X</i> can access the code in <i>Y</i> if there exists a dependency
  path between them that begins with a <code>deps</code> edge followed by zero or more
  <code>exports</code> edges. Let's see some examples to illustrate this.
</p>
<p>
  Assume <i>A</i> depends on <i>B</i> and <i>B</i> depends on <i>C</i>. In this case
  C is a <em>transitive</em> dependency of A, so changing C's sources and rebuilding A will
  correctly rebuild everything. However A will not be able to use classes in C. To allow
  that, either A has to declare C in its <code>deps</code>, or B can make it easier for A
  (and anything that may depend on A) by declaring C in its (B's) <code>exports</code>
  attribute.
</p>
<p>
  The closure of exported libraries is available to all direct parent rules. Take a slightly
  different example: A depends on B, B depends on C and D, and also exports C but not D.
  Now A has access to C but not to D. Now, if C and D exported some libraries, C' and D'
  respectively, A could only access C' but not D'.
</p>
<p>
  Important: an exported rule is not a regular dependency. Sticking to the previous example,
  if B exports C and wants to also use C, it has to also list it in its own
  <code>deps</code>.

srcs√
The list of source files that are processed to create the target.
This attribute is almost always required; see exceptions below.
<p>
Source files of type <code>.java</code> are compiled. In case of generated
<code>.java</code> files it is generally advisable to put the generating rule's name
here instead of the name of the file itself. This not only improves readability but
makes the rule more resilient to future changes: if the generating rule generates
different files in the future, you only need to fix one place: the <code>outs</code> of
the generating rule. You should not list the generating rule in <code>deps</code>
because it is a no-op.
</p>
<p>
Source files of type <code>.srcjar</code> are unpacked and compiled. (This is useful if
you need to generate a set of <code>.java</code> files with a genrule.)
</p>
<p>
Rules: if the rule (typically <code>genrule</code> or <code>filegroup</code>) generates
any of the files listed above, they will be used the same way as described for source

</p>

<p>All other files are ignored, as long as there is at least one file of a

See general comments about <code>data</code> at
<a href="${link common-definitions#typical-attributes}">Typical attributes defined by

<p>
  When building a <code>java_library</code>, Bazel doesn't put these files anywhere; if the
  <code>data</code> files are generated files then Bazel generates them. When building a
  test that depends on this <code>java_library</code> Bazel copies or links the

<p>
Resources may be source files or generated files.
</p>

<p>
If resources are specified, they will be bundled in the jar along with the usual
<code>.class</code> files produced by compilation. The location of the resources inside
of the jar file is determined by the project structure. Bazel first looks for Maven's
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html">standard directory layout</a>,
(a "src" directory followed by a "resources" directory grandchild). If that is not
found, Bazel then looks for the topmost directory named "java" or "javatests" (so, for
example, if a resource is at <code>&lt;workspace root&gt;/x/java/y/java/z</code>, the
path of the resource will be <code>y/java/z</code>. This heuristic cannot be overridden,
however, the <code>resource_strip_prefix</code> attribute can be used to specify a
specific alternative directory for resource files.2[]–

  The jars built by <code>java_library</code> rules listed in <code>deps</code> will be on

  to not fallback on the first argument.
</p>
<p>
  This attribute specifies the name of a Java class to be run by
  this test. It is rare to need to set this. If this argument is omitted,
  it will be inferred using the target's <code>name</code> and its
  source-root-relative path. If the test is located outside a known
  source root, Bazel will report an error if <code>test_class</code>
  is unset.
</p>
<p>
  For JUnit3, the test class needs to either be a subclass of
  <code>junit.framework.TestCase</code> or it needs to have a public
  static <code>suite()</code> method that returns a
  <code>junit.framework.Test</code> (or a subclass of <code>Test</code>).
  For JUnit4, the class needs to be annotated with

<code>java_binary</code> and <code>java_test</code> targets that have
<i>not</i> specified a <code>launcher</code> attribute.</p>

<p>Note that your native (C++, SWIG, JNI) dependencies will be built differently
depending on whether you are using the JDK launcher or another launcher:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using the normal JDK launcher (the default), native dependencies are
built as a shared library named <code>{name}_nativedeps.so</code>, where
<code>{name}</code> is the <code>name</code> attribute of this java_binary rule.
Unused code is <em>not</em> removed by the linker in this configuration.</li>

<li>If you are using any other launcher, native (C++) dependencies are statically
linked into a binary named <code>{name}_nativedeps</code>, where <code>{name}</code>
is the <code>name</code> attribute of this java_binary rule. In this case,
the linker will remove any code it thinks is unused from the resulting binary,
which means any C++ code accessed only via JNI may not be linked in unless

java_toolchain˛<p>
Specifies the configuration for the Java compiler. Which toolchain to be used can be changed through
the --java_toolchain argument. Normally you should not write those kind of rules unless you want to
tune your Java compiler.
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>A simple example would be:

<pre class="code">
<code class="lang-starlark">

java_toolchain(
    name = "toolchain",
    source_version = "7",
