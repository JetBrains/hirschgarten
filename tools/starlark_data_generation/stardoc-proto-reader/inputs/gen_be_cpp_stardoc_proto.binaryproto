binary_rules.cc_binaryé<p>It produces an executable binary.</p>

<br/>The <code>name</code> of the target should be the same as the name of the
source file that is the main entry point of the application (minus the extension).
For example, if your entry point is in <code>main.cc</code>, then your name should
be <code>main</code>.

<h4>Implicit output targets</h4>
<ul>
<li><code><var>name</var>.stripped</code> (only built if explicitly requested): A stripped
  version of the binary. <code>strip -g</code> is run on the binary to remove debug
  symbols.  Additional strip options can be provided on the command line using
  <code>--stripopt=-foo</code>.</li>
<li><code><var>name</var>.dwp</code> (only built if explicitly requested): If
  <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission">Fission</a> is enabled: a debug
  information package file suitable for debugging remotely deployed binaries. Else: an
  empty file.</li>
</ul>*
nameA unique name for this target. Ó
srcsﬂThe list of C and C++ files that are processed to create the library target.
These are C/C++ source and header files, either non-generated (normal source
code) or generated.
<p>All <code>.cc</code>, <code>.c</code>, and <code>.cpp</code> files will
   be compiled. These might be generated files: if a named file is in
   the <code>outs</code> of some other rule, this <code>cc_library</code>
   will automatically depend on that other rule.
</p>
<p>Pure assembler files (.s, .asm) are not preprocessed and are typically built using
the assembler. Preprocessed assembly files (.S) are preprocessed and are typically built
using the C/C++ compiler.
</p>
<p>A <code>.h</code> file will not be compiled, but will be available for
   inclusion by sources in this rule. Both <code>.cc</code> and
   <code>.h</code> files can directly include headers listed in
   these <code>srcs</code> or in the <code>hdrs</code> of this rule or any
   rule listed in the <code>deps</code> argument.
</p>
<p>All <code>#include</code>d files must be mentioned in the
   <code>hdrs</code> attribute of this or referenced <code>cc_library</code>
   rules, or they should be listed in <code>srcs</code> if they are private
   to this library. See <a href="#hdrs">"Header inclusion checking"</a> for
   a more detailed description.
</p>
<p><code>.so</code>, <code>.lo</code>, and <code>.a</code> files are
   pre-compiled files. Your library might have these as
   <code>srcs</code> if it uses third-party code for which we don't
   have source code.
</p>
<p>If the <code>srcs</code> attribute includes the label of another rule,
   <code>cc_library</code> will use the output files of that rule as source files to
   compile. This is useful for one-off generation of source code (for more than occasional
   use, it's better to implement a Starlark rule class and use the <code>cc_common</code>
   API)
</p>
<p>
  Permitted <code>srcs</code> file types:
</p>
<ul>
<li>C and C++ source files: <code>.c</code>, <code>.cc</code>, <code>.cpp</code>,
  <code>.cxx</code>, <code>.c++</code>, <code>.C</code></li>
<li>C and C++ header files: <code>.h</code>, <code>.hh</code>, <code>.hpp</code>,
  <code>.hxx</code>, <code>.inc</code>, <code>.inl</code>, <code>.H</code></li>
<li>Assembler with C preprocessor: <code>.S</code></li>
<li>Archive: <code>.a</code>, <code>.pic.a</code></li>
<li>"Always link" library: <code>.lo</code>, <code>.pic.lo</code></li>
<li>Shared library, versioned or unversioned: <code>.so</code>,
  <code>.so.<i>version</i></code></li>
<li>Object file: <code>.o</code>, <code>.pic.o</code></li>
</ul>

  ... and any rules that produce those files (e.g. <code>cc_embed_data</code>).
  Different extensions denote different programming languages in
  accordance with gcc convention.

linkstaticåFor <a href="${link cc_binary}"><code>cc_binary</code></a> and
<a href="${link cc_test}"><code>cc_test</code></a>: link the binary in static
mode. For <code>cc_library.link_static</code>: see below.
<p>By default this option is on for <code>cc_binary</code> and off for the rest.</p>
<p>
  If enabled and this is a binary or test, this option tells the build tool to link in
  <code>.a</code>'s instead of <code>.so</code>'s for user libraries whenever possible.
  System libraries such as libc (but <i>not</i> the C/C++ runtime libraries,
  see below) are still linked dynamically, as are libraries for which
  there is no static library. So the resulting executable will still be dynamically
  linked, hence only <i>mostly</i> static.
</p>
<p>
There are really three different ways to link an executable:
</p>
<ul>
<li> STATIC with fully_static_link feature, in which everything is linked statically;
  e.g. "<code>gcc -static foo.o libbar.a libbaz.a -lm</code>".<br/>
  This mode is enabled by specifying <code>fully_static_link</code> in the
  <a href="${link common-definitions#features}"><code>features</code></a> attribute.</li>
<li> STATIC, in which all user libraries are linked statically (if a static
  version is available), but where system libraries (excluding C/C++ runtime libraries)
  are linked dynamically, e.g. "<code>gcc foo.o libfoo.a libbaz.a -lm</code>".<br/>
  This mode is enabled by specifying <code>linkstatic=True</code>.</li>
<li> DYNAMIC, in which all libraries are linked dynamically (if a dynamic version is
  available), e.g. "<code>gcc foo.o libfoo.so libbaz.so -lm</code>".<br/>
  This mode is enabled by specifying <code>linkstatic=False</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the <code>linkstatic</code> attribute or <code>fully_static_link</code> in
<code>features</code> is used outside of <code>//third_party</code>
please include a comment near the rule to explain why.
</p>
<p>
The <code>linkstatic</code> attribute has a different meaning if used on a
<a href="${link cc_library}"><code>cc_library()</code></a> rule.
For a C++ library, <code>linkstatic=True</code> indicates that only
static linking is allowed, so no <code>.so</code> will be produced. linkstatic=False does
not prevent static libraries from being created. The attribute is meant to control the
creation of dynamic libraries.
</p>
<p>
There should be very little code built with <code>linkstatic=False</code> in production.
If <code>linkstatic=False</code>, then the build tool will create symlinks to
depended-upon shared libraries in the <code>*.runfiles</code> area.
</p>2True‰
mallocóOverride the default dependency on malloc.
<p>
  By default, C++ binaries are linked against <code>//tools/cpp:malloc</code>,
  which is an empty library so the binary ends up using libc malloc.
  This label must refer to a <code>cc_library</code>. If compilation is for a non-C++
  rule, this option has no effect. The value of this attribute is ignored if
  <code>linkshared=True</code> is specified.

link_extra_libÛControl linking of extra libraries.
<p>
    By default, C++ binaries are linked against <code>//tools/cpp:link_extra_lib</code>,
    which by default depends on the label flag <code>//tools/cpp:link_extra_libs</code>.
    Without setting the flag, this library is empty by default. Setting the label flag
    allows linking optional dependencies, such as overrides for weak symbols, interceptors
    for shared library functions, or special runtime libraries (for malloc replacements,
    prefer <code>malloc</code> or <code>--custom_malloc</code>). Setting this attribute to
    <code>None</code> disables this behaviour.

stampêWhether to encode build information into the binary. Possible values:
<ul>
<li>
  <code>stamp = 1</code>: Always stamp the build information into the binary, even in
  <a href="${link user-manual#flag--stamp}"><code>--nostamp</code></a> builds. <b>This
  setting should be avoided</b>, since it potentially kills remote caching for the
  binary and any downstream actions that depend on it.
</li>
<li>
  <code>stamp = 0</code>: Always replace build information by constant values. This
  gives good build result caching.
</li>
<li>
  <code>stamp = -1</code>: Embedding of build information is controlled by the
  <a href="${link user-manual#flag--stamp}"><code>--[no]stamp</code></a> flag.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stamped binaries are <em>not</em> rebuilt unless their dependencies change.</p>2-1Û

linkshared€Create a shared library.
To enable this attribute, include <code>linkshared=True</code> in your rule. By default
this option is off.
<p>
  The presence of this flag means that linking occurs with the <code>-shared</code> flag
  to <code>gcc</code>, and the resulting shared library is suitable for loading into for
  example a Java program. However, for build purposes it will never be linked into the
  dependent binary, as it is assumed that shared libraries built with a
  <a href="#cc_binary">cc_binary</a> rule are only loaded manually by other programs, so
  it should not be considered a substitute for the <a href="#cc_library">cc_library</a>
  rule. For sake of scalability we recommend avoiding this approach altogether and
  simply letting <code>java_library</code> depend on <code>cc_library</code> rules
  instead.
</p>
<p>
  If you specify both <code>linkopts=['-static']</code> and <code>linkshared=True</code>,
  you get a single completely self-contained unit. If you specify both
  <code>linkstatic=True</code> and <code>linkshared=True</code>, you get a single, mostly
  self-contained unit.

<code>cc_import</code> rules allows users to import precompiled C/C++ libraries.
</p>

<p>
The following are the typical use cases: <br/>

1. Linking a static library
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  static_library = "libmylib.a",
  # If alwayslink is turned on,
  # libmylib.a will be forcely linked into any binary that depends on it.
  # alwayslink = 1,
)
</code></pre>

2. Linking a shared library (Unix)
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  shared_library = "libmylib.so",
)
</code></pre>

3. Linking a shared library with interface library

<p>On Unix:
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  # libmylib.ifso is an interface library for libmylib.so which will be passed to linker
  interface_library = "libmylib.ifso",
  # libmylib.so will be available for runtime
  shared_library = "libmylib.so",

  interface_library = "mylib.lib",
  # mylib.dll will be available for runtime
  shared_library = "mylib.dll",
)
</code></pre>

4. Linking a shared library with <code>system_provided=True</code>

<p>On Unix:
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  interface_library = "libmylib.ifso", # Or we can also use libmylib.so as its own interface library
  # libmylib.so is provided by system environment, for example it can be found in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  # This indicates that Bazel is not responsible for making libmylib.so available.
  system_provided = 1,

  # mylib.dll is provided by system environment, for example it can be found in PATH.
  # This indicates that Bazel is not responsible for making mylib.dll available.

5. Linking to static or shared library

<p>On Unix:
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_import(
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib.h"],
  static_library = "libmylib.a",
  shared_library = "libmylib.so",

  static_library = "libmylib.lib", # A normal static library
  interface_library = "mylib.lib", # An import library for mylib.dll
  shared_library = "mylib.dll",
)
</code></pre>

<p>The remaining is the same on Unix and Windows:
<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
# first will link to libmylib.a (or libmylib.lib)
cc_binary(
  name = "first",
  srcs = ["first.cc"],
  deps = [":mylib"],
  linkstatic = 1, # default value

# second will link to libmylib.so (or libmylib.lib)
cc_binary(
  name = "second",

  All header files that are used in the build must be declared in
  the <code>hdrs</code> or <code>srcs</code> of <code>cc_*</code> rules.
  This is enforced.
</p>

<p>
  For <code>cc_library</code> rules, headers in <code>hdrs</code> comprise the
  public interface of the library and can be directly included both
  from the files in <code>hdrs</code> and <code>srcs</code> of the library
  itself as well as from files in <code>hdrs</code> and <code>srcs</code>
  of <code>cc_*</code> rules that list the library in their <code>deps</code>.
  Headers in <code>srcs</code> must only be directly included from the files
  in <code>hdrs</code> and <code>srcs</code> of the library itself. When
  deciding whether to put a header into <code>hdrs</code> or <code>srcs</code>,
  you should ask whether you want consumers of this library to be able to
  directly include it. This is roughly the same decision as
  between <code>public</code> and <code>private</code> visibility in programming languages.
</p>

<p>
  <code>cc_binary</code> and <code>cc_test</code> rules do not have an exported
  interface, so they also do not have a <code>hdrs</code> attribute. All headers
  that belong to the binary or test directly should be listed in
  the <code>srcs</code>.
</p>

<p>
  To illustrate these rules, look at the following example.
</p>

<pre><code class="lang-starlark">
cc_binary(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = [
        "foo.cc",
        "foo.h",
    ],
    deps = [":bar"],
)

cc_library(
    name = "bar",
    srcs = [
        "bar.cc",
        "bar-impl.h",
    ],
    hdrs = ["bar.h"],
    deps = [":baz"],
)

cc_library(
    name = "baz",
    srcs = [
        "baz.cc",
        "baz-impl.h",
    ],
    hdrs = ["baz.h"],
)
</code></pre>

<p>
  The allowed direct inclusions in this example are listed in the table below.
  For example <code>foo.cc</code> is allowed to directly
  include <code>foo.h</code> and <code>bar.h</code>, but not <code>baz.h</code>.
</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Including file</th><th>Allowed inclusions</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>foo.h</td><td>bar.h</td></tr>
    <tr><td>foo.cc</td><td>foo.h bar.h</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bar.h</td><td>bar-impl.h baz.h</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bar-impl.h</td><td>bar.h baz.h</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bar.cc</td><td>bar.h bar-impl.h baz.h</td></tr>
    <tr><td>baz.h</td><td>baz-impl.h</td></tr>
    <tr><td>baz-impl.h</td><td>baz.h</td></tr>
    <tr><td>baz.cc</td><td>baz.h baz-impl.h</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  The inclusion checking rules only apply to <em>direct</em>
  inclusions. In the example above <code>foo.cc</code> is allowed to
  include <code>bar.h</code>, which may include <code>baz.h</code>, which in
  turn is allowed to include <code>baz-impl.h</code>. Technically, the
  compilation of a <code>.cc</code> file may transitively include any header
  file in the <code>hdrs</code> or <code>srcs</code> in
  any <code>cc_library</code> in the transitive <code>deps</code> closure. In
  this case the compiler may read <code>baz.h</code> and <code>baz-impl.h</code>
  when compiling <code>foo.cc</code>, but <code>foo.cc</code> must not
  contain <code>#include "baz.h"</code>. For that to be
  allowed, <code>baz</code> must be added to the <code>deps</code>
  of <code>foo</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Bazel depends on toolchain support to enforce the inclusion checking rules.
  The <code>layering_check</code> feature has to be supported by the toolchain
  and requested explicitly, for example via the
  <code>--features=layering_check</code> command-line flag or the
  <code>features</code> parameter of the
  <a href="${link package}"><code>package</code></a> function. The toolchains
  provided by Bazel only support this feature with clang on Unix and macOS.

nameA unique name for this target. Ó
srcsﬂThe list of C and C++ files that are processed to create the library target.
These are C/C++ source and header files, either non-generated (normal source
code) or generated.
<p>All <code>.cc</code>, <code>.c</code>, and <code>.cpp</code> files will
   be compiled. These might be generated files: if a named file is in
   the <code>outs</code> of some other rule, this <code>cc_library</code>
   will automatically depend on that other rule.
</p>
<p>Pure assembler files (.s, .asm) are not preprocessed and are typically built using
the assembler. Preprocessed assembly files (.S) are preprocessed and are typically built
using the C/C++ compiler.
</p>
<p>A <code>.h</code> file will not be compiled, but will be available for
   inclusion by sources in this rule. Both <code>.cc</code> and
   <code>.h</code> files can directly include headers listed in
   these <code>srcs</code> or in the <code>hdrs</code> of this rule or any
   rule listed in the <code>deps</code> argument.
</p>
<p>All <code>#include</code>d files must be mentioned in the
   <code>hdrs</code> attribute of this or referenced <code>cc_library</code>
   rules, or they should be listed in <code>srcs</code> if they are private
   to this library. See <a href="#hdrs">"Header inclusion checking"</a> for
   a more detailed description.
</p>
<p><code>.so</code>, <code>.lo</code>, and <code>.a</code> files are
   pre-compiled files. Your library might have these as
   <code>srcs</code> if it uses third-party code for which we don't
   have source code.
</p>
<p>If the <code>srcs</code> attribute includes the label of another rule,
   <code>cc_library</code> will use the output files of that rule as source files to
   compile. This is useful for one-off generation of source code (for more than occasional
   use, it's better to implement a Starlark rule class and use the <code>cc_common</code>
   API)

includes•List of include dirs to be added to the compile line.
Subject to <a href="${link make-variables}">"Make variable"</a> substitution.
Each string is prepended with the package path and passed to the C++ toolchain for
expansion via the "include_paths" CROSSTOOL feature. A toolchain running on a POSIX system
with typical feature definitions will produce
<code>-isystem path_to_package/include_entry</code>.

alwayslink∑If 1, any binary that depends (directly or indirectly) on this C++
library will link in all the object files for the files listed in
<code>srcs</code>, even if some contain no symbols referenced by the binary.
This is useful if your code isn't explicitly called by code in
the binary, e.g., if your code registers to receive some callback
provided by some service.

<p>If alwayslink doesn't work with VS 2017 on Windows, that is due to a
<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3949">known issue</a>,
please upgrade your VS 2017 to the latest version.</p>2False§

linkstaticåFor <a href="${link cc_binary}"><code>cc_binary</code></a> and
<a href="${link cc_test}"><code>cc_test</code></a>: link the binary in static
mode. For <code>cc_library.link_static</code>: see below.
<p>By default this option is on for <code>cc_binary</code> and off for the rest.</p>
<p>
  If enabled and this is a binary or test, this option tells the build tool to link in
  <code>.a</code>'s instead of <code>.so</code>'s for user libraries whenever possible.
  System libraries such as libc (but <i>not</i> the C/C++ runtime libraries,
  see below) are still linked dynamically, as are libraries for which
  there is no static library. So the resulting executable will still be dynamically
  linked, hence only <i>mostly</i> static.
</p>
<p>
There are really three different ways to link an executable:
</p>
<ul>
<li> STATIC with fully_static_link feature, in which everything is linked statically;
  e.g. "<code>gcc -static foo.o libbar.a libbaz.a -lm</code>".<br/>
  This mode is enabled by specifying <code>fully_static_link</code> in the
  <a href="${link common-definitions#features}"><code>features</code></a> attribute.</li>
<li> STATIC, in which all user libraries are linked statically (if a static
  version is available), but where system libraries (excluding C/C++ runtime libraries)
  are linked dynamically, e.g. "<code>gcc foo.o libfoo.a libbaz.a -lm</code>".<br/>
  This mode is enabled by specifying <code>linkstatic=True</code>.</li>
<li> DYNAMIC, in which all libraries are linked dynamically (if a dynamic version is
  available), e.g. "<code>gcc foo.o libfoo.so libbaz.so -lm</code>".<br/>
  This mode is enabled by specifying <code>linkstatic=False</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the <code>linkstatic</code> attribute or <code>fully_static_link</code> in
<code>features</code> is used outside of <code>//third_party</code>
please include a comment near the rule to explain why.
</p>
<p>
The <code>linkstatic</code> attribute has a different meaning if used on a
<a href="${link cc_library}"><code>cc_library()</code></a> rule.
For a C++ library, <code>linkstatic=True</code> indicates that only
static linking is allowed, so no <code>.so</code> will be produced. linkstatic=False does
not prevent static libraries from being created. The attribute is meant to control the
creation of dynamic libraries.
</p>
<p>
There should be very little code built with <code>linkstatic=False</code> in production.
If <code>linkstatic=False</code>, then the build tool will create symlinks to
depended-upon shared libraries in the <code>*.runfiles</code> area.
</p>2False§
	linkstampéSimultaneously compiles and links the specified C++ source file into the final
binary. This trickery is required to introduce timestamp
information into binaries; if we compiled the source file to an
object file in the usual way, the timestamp would be incorrect.
A linkstamp compilation may not include any particular set of
compiler flags and so should not depend on any particular
header, compiler option, or other build variable.
<em class='harmful'>This option should only be needed in the
<code>base</code> package.</em>2None§
linkoptsëSee <a href="${link cc_binary.linkopts}"><code>cc_binary.linkopts</code></a>.
The <code>linkopts</code> attribute is also applied to any target that
depends, directly or indirectly, on this library via <code>deps</code>
attributes (or via other attributes that are treated similarly:
the <a href="${link cc_binary.malloc}"><code>malloc</code></a>
attribute of <a href="${link cc_binary}"><code>cc_binary</code></a>). Dependency
linkopts take precedence over dependent linkopts (i.e. dependency linkopts
appear later in the command line). Linkopts specified in
<a href='../user-manual.html#flag--linkopt'><code>--linkopt</code></a>
take precedence over rule linkopts.
</p>
<p>
Note that the <code>linkopts</code> attribute only applies
when creating <code>.so</code> files or executables, not
when creating <code>.a</code> or <code>.lo</code> files.
So if the <code>linkstatic=True</code> attribute is set, the
<code>linkopts</code> attribute has no effect on the creation of
this library, only on other targets which depend on this library.
</p>
<p>
Also, it is important to note that "-Wl,-soname" or "-Xlinker -soname"
options are not supported and should never be specified in this attribute.
</p>
<p> The <code>.so</code> files produced by <code>cc_library</code>
rules are not linked against the libraries that they depend
on.  If you're trying to create a shared library for use
outside of the main repository, e.g. for manual use
with <code>dlopen()</code> or <code>LD_PRELOAD</code>,
it may be better to use a <code>cc_binary</code> rule
with the <code>linkshared=True</code> attribute.
See <a href="${link cc_binary.linkshared}"><code>cc_binary.linkshared</code></a>.

<p>In the example <code>foo_shared</code> statically links <code>foo</code>
and <code>baz</code>, the latter being a transitive dependency. It doesn't
link <code>bar</code> because it is already provided dynamically by the
<code>dynamic_dep</code> <code>bar_shared</code>.</p>

<p><code>foo_shared</code> uses a linker script *.lds file to control which
symbols should be exported. The <code>cc_shared_library</code> rule logic does
not control which symbols get exported, it only uses what is assumed to be
exported to give errors during analysis phase if two shared libraries export the
same targets.</p>

<p>Every direct dependency of <code>cc_shared_library</code> is assumed to be
exported. Therefore, Bazel assumes during analysis that <code>foo</code> is being
exported by <code>foo_shared</code>. <code>baz</code> is not assumed to be exported
by <code>foo_shared</code>. Every target matched by the <code>exports_filter</code>
is also assumed to be exported.</p>

<p>Every single <code>cc_library</code> in the example should appear at most in one
<code>cc_shared_library</code>. If we wanted to link <code>baz</code> also into
<code>bar_shared</code> we would need to add
<code>tags = ["LINKABLE_MORE_THAN_ONCE"]</code> to <code>baz</code>.</p>

<h5><code>Two shared libraries in dependencies export the same symbols.</code></h5>

<p>This will happen whenever you are creating a target with two different
<code>cc_shared_library</code> dependencies that export the same target. To fix this
you need to stop the libraries from being exported in one of the
<code>cc_shared_library</code> dependencies.</p>

<h5><code>Two shared libraries in dependencies link the same library statically</code></h5>

<p>This will happen whenever you are creating a new <code>cc_shared_library</code> with two
different <code>cc_shared_library</code> dependencies that link the same target statically.
Similar to the error with exports.</p>

<p>One way to fix this is to stop linking the library into one of the
<code>cc_shared_library</code> dependencies. At the same time, the one that still links it
needs to export the library so that the one not linking it keeps visibility to
the symbols. Another way is to pull out a third library that exports the target.
A third way is to tag the culprit <code>cc_library</code> with <code>LINKABLE_MORE_THAN_ONCE</code>
but this fix should be rare and you should absolutely make sure that the
<code>cc_library</code> is indeed safe to link more than once.</p>

<h5><code>'//foo:foo' is already linked statically in '//bar:bar' but not exported`</code></h5>

<p>This means that a library in the transitive closure of your <code>deps</code> is reachable
without going through one of the <code>cc_shared_library</code> dependencies but is already
linked into a different <code>cc_shared_library</code> in <code>dynamic_deps</code> and is not
exported.</p>

<p>The solution is to export it from the <code>cc_shared_library</code> dependency or pull out
a third <code>cc_shared_library</code> that exports it.</p>

<h5><code>Do not place libraries which only contain a precompiled dynamic library in deps.
</code></h5>

<p>If you have a precompiled dynamic library, this doesn't need to and cannot be
linked statically into the current <code>cc_shared_library</code> target that you are
currently creating. Therefore, it doesn't belong in <code>deps</code> of the
<code>cc_shared_library</code>. If this precompiled dynamic library is a dependency of one
of your <code>cc_libraries</code>, then the <code>cc_library</code> needs to depend on it
directly.</p>

<h5><code>Trying to export a library already exported by a different shared library</code></h5>

<p>You will see this error if on the current rule you are claiming to export a
target that is already being exported by one of your dynamic dependencies.</p>

<p>To fix this, remove the target from <code>deps</code> and just rely on it from the dynamic
dependency or make sure that the <code>exports_filter</code> doesn't catch this target.</p>*

shared_lib_nameÜBy default cc_shared_library will use a name for the shared library output file based on

<p>
Any target <code>deps</code> is already understood to be exported by the shared library.
This attribute should be used to list any targets that are exported by the shared library

<p>
Note that this attribute is not actually adding a dependency edge to those targets, the

this is considered a claim that the shared library exports the symbols from that target.
The <code>cc_shared_library</code> logic  doesn't actually handle telling the linker which
symbols should be exported.

Any transitive library dependency of these direct deps will be linked into this shared
library as long as they have not already been linked by a <code>cc_shared_library</code>

<p>
During analysis, the rule implementation will consider any target listed in

multiple <code>cc_shared_libraries</code> export the same targets. The rule implementation
does not take care of informing the linker about which symbols should be exported by the
shared object. The user should take care of this via linker scripts or visibility
declarations in the source code.</p>

<p>
The implementation will also trigger errors whenever the same library is linked statically
into more than one <code>cc_shared_library</code>. This can be avoided by adding
<code>"LINKABLE_MORE_THAN_ONCE"</code> to the <code>cc_library.tags</code> or by listing
the `cc_library` as an export of one of the shared libraries so that one can be made a

linkstaticåFor <a href="${link cc_binary}"><code>cc_binary</code></a> and
<a href="${link cc_test}"><code>cc_test</code></a>: link the binary in static
mode. For <code>cc_library.link_static</code>: see below.
<p>By default this option is on for <code>cc_binary</code> and off for the rest.</p>
<p>
  If enabled and this is a binary or test, this option tells the build tool to link in
  <code>.a</code>'s instead of <code>.so</code>'s for user libraries whenever possible.
  System libraries such as libc (but <i>not</i> the C/C++ runtime libraries,
  see below) are still linked dynamically, as are libraries for which
  there is no static library. So the resulting executable will still be dynamically
  linked, hence only <i>mostly</i> static.
</p>
<p>
There are really three different ways to link an executable:
</p>
<ul>
<li> STATIC with fully_static_link feature, in which everything is linked statically;
  e.g. "<code>gcc -static foo.o libbar.a libbaz.a -lm</code>".<br/>
  This mode is enabled by specifying <code>fully_static_link</code> in the
  <a href="${link common-definitions#features}"><code>features</code></a> attribute.</li>
<li> STATIC, in which all user libraries are linked statically (if a static
  version is available), but where system libraries (excluding C/C++ runtime libraries)
  are linked dynamically, e.g. "<code>gcc foo.o libfoo.a libbaz.a -lm</code>".<br/>
  This mode is enabled by specifying <code>linkstatic=True</code>.</li>
<li> DYNAMIC, in which all libraries are linked dynamically (if a dynamic version is
  available), e.g. "<code>gcc foo.o libfoo.so libbaz.so -lm</code>".<br/>
  This mode is enabled by specifying <code>linkstatic=False</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the <code>linkstatic</code> attribute or <code>fully_static_link</code> in
<code>features</code> is used outside of <code>//third_party</code>
please include a comment near the rule to explain why.
</p>
<p>
The <code>linkstatic</code> attribute has a different meaning if used on a
<a href="${link cc_library}"><code>cc_library()</code></a> rule.
For a C++ library, <code>linkstatic=True</code> indicates that only
static linking is allowed, so no <code>.so</code> will be produced. linkstatic=False does
not prevent static libraries from being created. The attribute is meant to control the
creation of dynamic libraries.
</p>
<p>
There should be very little code built with <code>linkstatic=False</code> in production.
If <code>linkstatic=False</code>, then the build tool will create symlinks to
depended-upon shared libraries in the <code>*.runfiles</code> area.

mallocóOverride the default dependency on malloc.
<p>
  By default, C++ binaries are linked against <code>//tools/cpp:malloc</code>,

    Without setting the flag, this library is empty by default. Setting the label flag
    allows linking optional dependencies, such as overrides for weak symbols, interceptors

<li>

linkshared€Create a shared library.
To enable this attribute, include <code>linkshared=True</code> in your rule. By default
this option is off.
<p>
  The presence of this flag means that linking occurs with the <code>-shared</code> flag
  to <code>gcc</code>, and the resulting shared library is suitable for loading into for
  example a Java program. However, for build purposes it will never be linked into the
  dependent binary, as it is assumed that shared libraries built with a
  <a href="#cc_binary">cc_binary</a> rule are only loaded manually by other programs, so
  it should not be considered a substitute for the <a href="#cc_library">cc_library</a>
  rule. For sake of scalability we recommend avoiding this approach altogether and
  simply letting <code>java_library</code> depend on <code>cc_library</code> rules
  instead.
</p>
<p>
  If you specify both <code>linkopts=['-static']</code> and <code>linkshared=True</code>,
  you get a single completely self-contained unit. If you specify both

<code>dynamic_deps</code> (transitively, i.e. also the <code>dynamic_deps</code> of the
current target's <code>dynamic_deps</code>) to decide which <code>cc_libraries</code> in
the transitive <code>deps</code> should not be linked in because they are already provided
by a different <code>cc_shared_library</code>.*[

other_rules.cc_toolchainˇ<p>Represents a C++ toolchain.</p>

<p>
  This rule is responsible for:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Collecting all artifacts needed for C++ actions to run. This is done by
      attributes such as <code>all_files</code>, <code>compiler_files</code>,
      <code>linker_files</code>, or other attributes ending with <code>_files</code>). These are
      most commonly filegroups globbing all required files.
    </li>
    <li>
      Generating correct command lines for C++ actions. This is done using
      <code>CcToolchainConfigInfo</code> provider (details below).
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Use <code>toolchain_config</code> attribute to configure the C++ toolchain.
  See also this
  <a href="https://bazel.build/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference">
    page
  </a> for elaborate C++ toolchain configuration and toolchain selection documentation.
</p>
<p>
  Use <code>tags = ["manual"]</code> in order to prevent toolchains from being built and configured
  unnecessarily when invoking <code>bazel build //...</code>

crosstool_config.toolchain.

<p>
  Until issue <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5380">#5380</a> is fixed
  this is the recommended way of associating <code>cc_toolchain</code> with
  <code>CROSSTOOL.toolchain</code>. It will be replaced by the <code>toolchain_config</code>
  attribute (<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5380">#5380</a>).</p>2""´
	all_filesôCollection of all cc_toolchain artifacts. These artifacts will be added as inputs to all
rules_cc related actions (with the exception of actions that are using more precise sets of
artifacts from attributes below). Bazel assumes that <code>all_files</code> is a superset
of all other artifact-providing attributes (e.g. linkstamp compilation needs both compile
and link files, so it takes <code>all_files</code>).

<p>
This is what <code>cc_toolchain.files</code> contains, and this is used by all Starlark
rules using C++ toolchain.</p> \
