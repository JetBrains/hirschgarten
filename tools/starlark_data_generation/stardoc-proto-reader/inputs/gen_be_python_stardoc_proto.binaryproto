other_rules.py_runtimeÉ	Represents a Python runtime used to execute Python code.

A `py_runtime` target can represent either a *platform runtime* or an *in-build
runtime*. A platform runtime accesses a system-installed interpreter at a known
path, whereas an in-build runtime points to an executable target that acts as
the interpreter. In both cases, an "interpreter" means any executable binary or
wrapper script that is capable of running a Python script passed on the command
line, following the same conventions as the standard CPython interpreter.

A platform runtime is by its nature non-hermetic. It imposes a requirement on
the target platform to have an interpreter located at a specific path. An
in-build runtime may or may not be hermetic, depending on whether it points to
a checked-in interpreter or a wrapper script that accesses the system
interpreter.

Example

```
load("@rules_python//python:py_runtime.bzl", "py_runtime")

py_runtime(
    name = "python-2.7.12",
    files = glob(["python-2.7.12/**"]),
    interpreter = "python-2.7.12/bin/python",
)

py_runtime(
    name = "python-3.6.0",
    interpreter_path = "/opt/pyenv/versions/3.6.0/bin/python",
)

bootstrap_templateÍThe bootstrap script template file to use. Should have %python_binary%,
%workspace_name%, %main%, and %imports%.

This template, after expansion, becomes the executable file used to start the
process, so it is responsible for initial bootstrapping actions such as finding
the Python interpreter, runfiles, and constructing an environment to run the
intended Python application.

While this attribute is currently optional, it will become required when the
Python rules are moved out of Bazel itself.

The exact variable names expanded is an unstable API and is subject to change.
The API will become more stable when the Python rules are moved out of Bazel
itself.

coverage_toolõThis is a target to use for collecting code coverage information from
{rule}`py_binary` and {rule}`py_test` targets.

If set, the target must either produce a single file or be an executable target.
The path to the single file, or the executable if the target is executable,
determines the entry point for the python coverage tool.  The target and its
runfiles will be added to the runfiles when coverage is enabled.

The entry point for the tool must be loadable by a Python interpreter (e.g. a
`.py` or `.pyc` file).  It must accept the command line arguments
of [`coverage.py`](https://coverage.readthedocs.io), at least including
the `run` and `lcov` subcommands.2NoneÂ

  NOTE: the runfiles of the target may not yet be properly respected/propagated
